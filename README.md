## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to determine the impact of climate change on crop production. It will include analysis on how weather related conditions such as precipitation, temperature changes, drought conditions, and significant weather events affect major crops grown in the U.S. This information would prove useful to individuals who are responsible for making business decisions in industries that rely upon American agriculture providing consistent yields

## Project Description
Over half of the U.S. land area, 1.3 billion acres according to the USDA Economic Research Service as of 2012, is used for agricultural production. With the concentration of crop production located within California and the Midwest, the constant threat of wildfires, freezes, flooding and tornadic events proves to be a reoccurring risk for agriculture. The weather and climate disasters of 2020 left over $3.6 billion in uncovered crop and rangeland losses. 
Projected increases in temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, changes in extreme weather events, and reductions in water availability may all result in reduced agricultural productivity and subsequently reduced business profitability. The increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events can interrupt crop management and logistics while increasing temperatures can contribute to the spoilage and contamination of crops. This can result in food prices spiking after extreme events and can worsen if they are expected to be more frequent in the future.
